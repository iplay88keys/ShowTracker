# Show Tracker

This is a personal project to create a website that pulls from TVDB to keep track of tv show episodes watched.

Show Tracker is built in Laravel 4 and is effectively finished. The only things missing that would be required to release as a public app is a user signup form and database credentials.

I may remake this in the future in Ruby on Rails and expand the concept further.
