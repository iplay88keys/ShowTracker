# Show Tracker

**[Rebuilt using Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/iplay88keys/ShowTracker2)**


This is a personal project to create a website that pulls from TVDB to keep track of tv show episodes watched.

Show Tracker is built in Laravel 4 and is effectively finished. The only things missing are a user signup form and database credentials.
